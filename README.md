# Discord Channel Collapse Button
A small snippit that creates a button to hide the channel list on Discord. Rewritten to fix some broken class definitions.

# Warning
Do not use this script unless you know exacltly what you're doing.

I'm still working on getting everything working, so there will be instability for some time. Technically, the functionality works as it should, but the styling of the new button is still broken. I havent even looked at the BetterDiscord version yet, so definetely avoid that for now.

## How To Use

### For BetterDiscord Client Users
1. Download [channelcollapsebutton.plugin.js](https://github.com/ThatDeaf-ITGuy/discord-channel-collapse-button/blob/master/channelcollapsebutton.plugin.js)
2. Put it in your plugins directory (Just open it from the client, can vary between indivudla users).
3. Restart BetterDiscord

### For Normal Discord Client (desktop and Web view) Users:
1. Go into your discord client settings and enable developer mode.
  * This can be accessed under the Appearance area.
2. Open the developer console.
  * This can vary depending on your OS and keyboard.  It would be the same way you open the developer tools in Chrome or FireFox.
     - On standard QWERTY Windows, the keybinding is CTRL+SHIFT+I (that's the letter "eye", not the number 1).
     - On standard QWERTY macOS, the keybinding is Command+Option+I (that's the letter "eye", not the number 1)
  * The window will look something like this ![http://i.imgur.com/mvUxbLi.png](http://i.imgur.com/mvUxbLi.png)
3. Paste in the code from [main.js](https://github.com/ThatDeaf-ITGuy/discord-channel-collapse-button/blob/master/main.js) into the **Console** tab
4. Press enter
5. Enjoy the newly added feature*

\* Unfortunately, with the normal discord client, the button disapepars whenever you switch servers.
